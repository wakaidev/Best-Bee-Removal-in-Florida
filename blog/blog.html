        Did you know the honeybee is not native to North America? You mean someone <strong>CHOSE</strong>
        to bring bees into the US?
        </p>

        <div class="tip tip-right">
          <p>
          Honeybees have a long-standing relationship with humans - providing honey, beeswax, and both commercial and wild pollination. They are a natural pollinator, providing a great benefit to food supply crops and local agriculture. Most honeybees in the United States are maintained in artificial hives by professional beekeepers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="article-content">
          Honeybees will only swarm about once a year. A swarm occurs when the old queen leaves the hive with a portion of the hive. Those that stay behind work with a new recently born queen. A future queen is fed a special diet by the worker bees, making her fertile. The other female larvae are fed a regular diet which renders them infertile. The worker bees are those sterile female bees that didn’t make the “Queen Bee” cut. Male drone bees stay in the hive live a short life, residing in the hive during times of reproduction and are then killed by worker bees. It is rare that the bee you would see bumbling by in your yard is a honeybee, and even more rare that they would stop to sting you. That a bee can only sting you once is true... of honeybees - wasps, carpenter bees, and yellow jackets are another story.

        <p>In those Polaroids, she drove the ink into the canvas like a slave beneath his master’s cruel hand, and I
          hated that
          whip but always wondered what I’d do without it, so I grew to love the man</p>

        <p>Oh, I wept for change! I begged for movement and the good Lord, he answered my prayers, but you don’t know
          how to
          breathe
          easy when you let go of your habits, even if your comforts left you gasping for air</p> -->

        <p>Grandfather's as creaky as his front porch, scent like oil in the gun barrel, dip-can kicked over the
          railing,
          sandpaper
          hands stuck behind thumb tacks on my wall. I’ve got an ache in my chest for every season I miss and it gets
          worse when
          the snow starts to fall. There are butterflies alive in that couple’s eyes a few years since forgotten by all,
          and
          sometimes, if the phone starts to ring, I can still hear their wings when you call</p>

        <p>But I begged for movement and I got what I asked for, and I can picture the answer like it came yesterday.
          And in the
          land of the gods, I think that things are timeless, but we are still prone to decay</p>

        <p>You know I still lift up hope of certain smiles in those photos for us when I pray</p>

        <p>Time is a cruel lover, and she breaks her house apart at its bones. You know comfort is no good reason for
          standing
          still,
          and idle hands build nothing that you can call your own.</p>
