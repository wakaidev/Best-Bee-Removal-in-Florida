        <p>The bees were everywhere. Swarmed over my mask enough to block out the sun. Panic sets in as the sound of buzzing
          is all I can hear. My only hope is that my partner brings out the smoke. I yell but I am afraid no one can hear
          me.</p>

        <p>In a perfect world we shouldn’t have been allowed to lose sight of what it means to love wholly. I’ve got a Polaroid
          hanging on my wall that a friend took of me and my angel. I remember the day like it’s something I can touch, but it’s
          stuck in the square between the borders of the film, and I can run my fingers over our faces, but I can’t get back
          to the places we were</p>
        
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>"You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward like you’re tied to a slave master’s cruel hand,
          and
          it's the same pain that drives that oppressor’s heart of stone, so you’ve grown to love the man. You keep pouring
          yourself
          out, again and again, into legible lines through a crooked pen." Yeah, it’s painful, but it’s familiar – so habit
          breeds
          comfort, and I don’t know what I’d do without him</p>

          <div class="tip tip-left">
            <p>Here's another tip</p>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Molestiae totam quia vel eveniet porro, rem ducimus quam.</p>
          </div>

          <p>I know my sweet seductress, and her name is Depression. I wrote best beneath that demon’s destructive oppression</p>

          <p>In those Polaroids, she drove the ink into the canvas like a slave beneath his master’s cruel hand, and I hated that
            whip but always wondered what I’d do without it, so I grew to love the man</p>

          <p>Oh, I wept for change! I begged for movement and the good Lord, he answered my prayers, but you don’t know how to
            breathe
            easy when you let go of your habits, even if your comforts left you gasping for air</p>

          <h2>Dear Time</h2>
          
          <p>Grandfather's as creaky as his front porch, scent like oil in the gun barrel, dip-can kicked over the railing,
            sandpaper
            hands stuck behind thumb tacks on my wall. I’ve got an ache in my chest for every season I miss and it gets worse when
            the snow starts to fall. There are butterflies alive in that couple’s eyes a few years since forgotten by all, and
            sometimes, if the phone starts to ring, I can still hear their wings when you call</p>
          
          <p>But I begged for movement and I got what I asked for, and I can picture the answer like it came yesterday. And in the
            land of the gods, I think that things are timeless, but we are still prone to decay</p>
          
          <p>You know I still lift up hope of certain smiles in those photos for us when I pray</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Idle hands build nothing that you can call your own"</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>Time is a cruel lover, and she breaks her house apart at its bones. You know comfort is no good reason for standing
            still,
            and idle hands build nothing that you can call your own.</p>
